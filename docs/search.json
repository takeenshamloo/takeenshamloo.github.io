    "text": "Introduction:\nGreenhouse gases are a major driver of climate change, affecting everything from our air quality to the economy’s stability. In the United States, the energy industry is a major contributor to GHG emissions because of how we use coal, natural gas, and oil. It’s really important to understand the impact of these different fuel sources so we can come up with better climate policies and move towards cleaner energy in the future.\nThis study asks an important question: How much do emissions from coal and natural gas predict the total amount of GHG emissions in the U.S.? By looking at emissions data from the past fifty years, we hope to learn more about emission trends and how we can make better energy policies to reduce them.\nThis research is important because it helps connect what we know about emissions from a scientific standpoint to how we actually implement policies. While a lot of existing studies focus on overall emissions, there’s not as much detail about the specific contributions of coal and natural gas. This study aims to fill that gap and give us a clearer picture of how these fuel sources impact our environment and how the energy sector is changing over time.\n\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Link to the data.\nMotivation: Understanding the role of coal and natural gas emissions in contributing to total GHG emissions is essential for shaping energy policies. These insights can help evaluate the effectiveness of transitioning to cleaner energy sources and inform future environmental strategies. Prior research has focused on aggregate emissions trends, but the specific contributions of individual fuel sources require further exploration.\nHypotheses:\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀): Coal and natural gas emissions do not significantly predict total GHG emissions.\nAlternative Hypothesis (H₁): Coal and natural gas emissions significantly predict total GHG emissions."

This is followed by a gradual decline, aligning with shifts in energy reliance driven by climate policies and technological innovation. The adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar played a crucial role in reversing this trend.\nThe shift around 2005 is particularly significant, as it coincides with major federal and state-level environmental policies aimed at reducing coal use, such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). These efforts, coupled with the economic viability of natural gas due to advancements in hydraulic fracturing, marked a turning point in the U.S. energy sector."

Despite stable petroleum emissions, the energy landscape has undergone significant transformations, signaling policy-driven shifts and advancements in energy efficiency.\nNatural gas stands out as a ‘bridge fuel.’ Its cleaner than coal, making it a popular choice. But there’s a downside: leaks during production and transport could undo its benefits. This underscores the need for balanced policy approaches that weigh short-term reductions against long-term sustainability.\nAdditionally, the stability of petroleum emissions indicates that the transportation sector remains a significant challenge. The lack of substantial reduction in this area highlights the need for increased adoption of electric vehicles and alternative fuels."

These coefficients underscore their critical role in shaping national emissions profiles.\nTemporal Decline: The year variable (β = -11.91) reflects a downward trend, aligning with broader shifts toward decarbonization.\nModel Strength: An adjusted R² of 0.93 indicates the model effectively explains 93% of total emissions variation.\n\nThe significant coefficients validate the importance of coal and natural gas in determining overall GHG emissions. The results highlight that while natural gas is contributing to reductions in total emissions, its overall impact is moderated by its role in replacing coal rather than being phased out itself."

    "text": "Introduction:\nGreenhouse gases are a major driver of climate change, affecting everything from our air quality to the economy’s stability. In the United States, the energy industry is a major contributor to GHG emissions because of how we use coal, natural gas, and oil. It’s really important to understand the impact of these different fuel sources so we can come up with better climate policies and move towards cleaner energy in the future.\nThis study asks an important question: How much do emissions from coal and natural gas predict the total amount of GHG emissions in the U.S.? By looking at emissions data from the past fifty years, we hope to learn more about emission trends and how we can make better energy policies to reduce them.\nThis research is important because it helps connect what we know about emissions from a scientific standpoint to how we actually implement policies. While a lot of existing studies focus on overall emissions, there’s not as much detail about the specific contributions of coal and natural gas. This study aims to fill that gap and give us a clearer picture of how these fuel sources impact our environment and how the energy sector is changing over time.\n\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Link to the data.\nMotivation: Understanding the role of coal and natural gas emissions in contributing to total GHG emissions is essential for shaping energy policies. These insights can help evaluate the effectiveness of transitioning to cleaner energy sources and inform future environmental strategies. Prior research has focused on aggregate emissions trends, but the specific contributions of individual fuel sources require further exploration.\nHypotheses:\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀): Coal and natural gas emissions do not significantly predict total GHG emissions.\nAlternative Hypothesis (H₁): Coal and natural gas emissions significantly predict total GHG emissions."

This is followed by a gradual decline, aligning with shifts in energy reliance driven by climate policies and technological innovation. The adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar played a crucial role in reversing this trend.\nThe shift around 2005 is particularly significant, as it coincides with major federal and state-level environmental policies aimed at reducing coal use, such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). These efforts, coupled with the economic viability of natural gas due to advancements in hydraulic fracturing, marked a turning point in the U.S. energy sector."

Despite stable petroleum emissions, the energy landscape has undergone significant transformations, signaling policy-driven shifts and advancements in energy efficiency.\nNatural gas stands out as a ‘bridge fuel.’ Its cleaner than coal, making it a popular choice. But there’s a downside: leaks during production and transport could undo its benefits. This underscores the need for balanced policy approaches that weigh short-term reductions against long-term sustainability.\nAdditionally, the stability of petroleum emissions indicates that the transportation sector remains a significant challenge. The lack of substantial reduction in this area highlights the need for increased adoption of electric vehicles and alternative fuels."

The results highlight that while natural gas is contributing to reductions in total emissions, its overall impact is moderated by its role in replacing coal rather than being phased out itself."

By looking at daily AQI and calculating a 5-day rolling average we can see how the fire impacted air quality in Santa Barbara County.\nThe AQI dataset includes daily air quality measurements for every county in the U.S. These values are essential for spotting anomalies and understanding how wildfire events affect local air quality.\n\n\n\n# Loading the data\n#aqi_17 = pd.read_csv(\"https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.zip\", compression='zip')\n#aqi_18 = pd.read_csv(\"https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.zip\", compression='zip')\n\n# Server was down had to used downloaded csv files of the data\naqi_17 = pd.read_csv(\"data/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.csv\")\naqi_18 = pd.read_csv(\"data/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.csv\")\n\nSo, first off, we couldn’t grab the data from the internet directly because the server was down but I have left the commented out code if needed. Instead, downloaded the data locally as CSV files. They have all the air quality info (AQI) for every county in the U.S. for 2017 and 2018. Each file is a year’s worth of daily AQI data.\n\n\n\n\n# Combining datasets and cleaning column names\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\naqi.columns = aqi.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')\n\nHere we’re smushing the 2017 and 2018 data into one big dataset so we can look at everything together. I cleaned up the column names too and made them lowercase as well as swapped out spaces for underscores. This step is imperative as it will make the data a lot easier to work with later.\n\n\n\n\n# Filtering for Santa Barbara County\naqi_sb = aqi[aqi['county_name'] == 'Santa Barbara']\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.drop(['state_name', 'county_name', 'state_code', 'county_code'], axis=1)\n\nThis step is fairly simple we only care about Santa Barbara County, so I filtered out the rest of the data. Also, I ditched some columns like state name and county code since we don’t really need those. No point keeping extra stuff around that could potentially confuse us later.\n\n\n\n\n# Converting date column to datetime and setting it as the index\naqi_sb['date'] = pd.to_datetime(aqi_sb['date'])\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.set_index('date')\n\nUsing the code above I made sure the date column is in a proper date format because we’re working with time-series data (fancy word for data over time). Then I set it as the index which just means we can use the dates to organize the data.\n\n\n\n\n# Calculating a 5-day rolling average for AQI\naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = aqi_sb['aqi'].rolling('5D').mean()\n\nThis is where the fun begins! I calculated a 5-day rolling average. Basically, it smooths out the daily ups and downs so we can see bigger trends. It’s like looking at the bigger picture instead of freaking out about every little bump.\n\n\n\n\n# Plotting the results\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))\nplt.plot(aqi_sb.index.values, aqi_sb['aqi'].values, label='Daily AQI', color='green', linewidth=1.5)\nplt.plot(aqi_sb.index.values, aqi_sb['five_day_average'].values, label='5-Day Average AQI', color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=1.5)\nplt.title('Daily and 5 Day Rolling Average AQI in Santa Barbara')\nplt.xlabel('Date (2017-18)')\nplt.ylabel('AQI')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on my visualization, the graph to show what’s happening with AQI. The green line is the daily AQI which jumps around a lot. The red dashed line is the 5-day rolling average which is way smoother. You can see a massive spike in December 2017 because of the Thomas Fire we can see AQI at a peak reading of ~265 AQI score which is way over the ~50 AQI score we can see assume off the baseline."
